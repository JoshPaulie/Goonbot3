## New & Reworked Features

### Twitch links 📺

**Updated** Twitch links now return if user is live!

**NEW**  `.live` returns if any g00ns are streaming! ♥

**Alternate functionality** Add a username ( `.live souljaboy` ) to see if *anyone* is streaming

### Community-powered moderation 🧑‍⚖️

**NEW** Messages with 5x "🚮" reactions are auto-removed

**Alternatively** messages sent by *Goonbot* are removed with a single "🚮" 

### Reworked Hobo Username Puller 🗳

**Updated** Usernames are now loaded into memory at launch. When one is pulled, it is also deleted from the list (until the next reboot). This should reduce the frequency of duplicate name pulls

### Uniform embeds, affirmations, and cosmetic changes 🎨

**Updated** The bot is a lot prettier.

## The classic, don't-fix-if-it's-not-broken commands 🌟

### .vtuber
### .pfp
